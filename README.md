## 2. Expectations

This simple application works, but with very old-style monolithic codebase, so do anything you want with it, to make it:

- easier to work with
- more maintainable

## 3. Changes
- added autoloading
- added doctrine as a data mapper in database
- added foreign key relationship between two entities
